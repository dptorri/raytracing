Several raytracing concepts and examples

#### Add CMakeLists

This is a `CMakeLists.txt` file for the "raytracer" project. Let's step through each component:

* `cmake_minimum_required (VERSION 2.8)`: Sets the minimum required version of CMake that this project supports to 2.8.
* `project (raytracer)`: Sets the project name to "raytracer".
* `include(CheckCXXCompilerFlag)`: Includes the `CheckCXXCompilerFlag` module provided by CMake. This module provides 
* `check_cxx_compiler_flag`, which checks if a specific compiler flag is supported by the C++ compiler.
* `function(enable_cxx_compiler_flag_if_supported flag)`: Defines a function that enables a given C++ compiler flag 
* if it's supported. This function first checks if the flag is already present in the `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`. If not, it 
* checks if the flag is supported and if so, it adds the flag to `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`.
* `enable_cxx_compiler_flag_if_supported("-Wall")`, `enable_cxx_compiler_flag_if_supported("-Wextra")`, etc.: These 
* lines use the defined function to add a variety of flags. These flags control various settings like warning levels,
* enabling certain language features (C++11), optimization levels, and OpenMP (a standard for parallel programming).
* `file(GLOB SOURCES *.h *.cpp)`: Uses a glob pattern to include all `.h` header and `.cpp` source files in the build.
* `add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} ${SOURCES})`: Tells CMake to create an executable with the name of the project 
* ("raytracer") using the source files defined before.

#### Geometry Header 

`geometry.h` header file provides functionality for working with vectors of different dimensions.
- **Guarding Against Multiple Inclusions**: The file starts with include guards (`#ifndef`, `#define`, `#endif`) to
- prevent multiple inclusions in the same translation unit.
- **Includes**: Standard library headers such as `<cmath>`, `<vector>`, `<cassert>`, and `<iostream>` are included.
- **Constants**: Constants are defined for dimensions 2, 3, and 4 (`DIM2`, `DIM3`, `DIM4`).
- **Generic Vector Struct (`vec`)**: A templated struct `vec` is defined to represent vectors of arbitrary dimensions. 
- It provides functionality for creating and accessing vector elements.
- **Specializations for 2D, 3D, and 4D Vectors**: Specializations of `vec` are provided for 2D, 3D, and 4D vectors, 
- each with their own set of constructors and element accessors.
- **Element Access**: Overloaded `operator[]` functions are provided to access vector elements using square brackets
- (`[]`). Bounds checking is performed using `assert` to ensure index validity.
- **Member Variables**: Inside the specializations, each vector struct contains member variables (`x`, `y`, `z`, `w`) 
- representing vector components.

#### Ray Tracer

- **Include Directives**: Libraries and files are included at the top of the code using the `#include` directive.
- **Geometry Module**: "geometry.h" is utilized for dealing with 3D vectors, which are essential in a ray tracer.
- **Constants Definition**: Constants `IMAGE_WIDTH`, `IMAGE_HEIGHT`, and `IMAGE_PATH` define the dimensions of the 
- image produced by the ray tracer and the path where the image is saved, respectively.
- **generateFrameBuffer() Function**: This function creates a framebuffer, a matrix of color values for each pixel 
- in the image. Color values are generated by setting normalized x and y coordinates as red and green components, 
- with the blue component set to 0.
- **writeFrameBuffer() Function**: Writes the framebuffer pixel data to a file in PPM (Portable PixMap) format, a 
- simple image format. `std::ofstream` is used to open and write into the file. Pixel color components are clamped 
- between 0 and 1, then scaled to a range of 0 to 255.
- **render() Function**: Simply creates the framebuffer, generates pixel data with `generateFrameBuffer()`, and writes 
- the framebuffer to the file using `writeFrameBuffer()`.
- **main() Function**: Entry point of the program. Calls the `render()` function to generate the ray-traced image. 
- The newly generated image is displayed using the `open` command in the terminal.
